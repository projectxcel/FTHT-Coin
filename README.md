FTHT Coin is a coin with no utility and no use case. It is meant to be a coin like doge was intended to be. A coin for fun that is decentralized. If you want to get this coin on an exchange, go for it. If you want to have fun with it, go for it. It is completely up to the community. There is no roadmap, and there will not be a way to trade FTHT Coin for FTHT Tokens V1 or V2. Unless, someone creates a way. There will be no other upgrades or development completed by the Project Excelsior Dev team. We may add a wallet for Android later on. 

Instructions:

Download and install the file: fuckthemheggiescoin-0.15.1-win64-setup.exe This is the FTHT Coin core for Windows. You may get an error from Windows 10, however, it is safe to ignore this error and install the file. 

Once the wallet has been installed, you need to add the configuration file. Open up the file in the github called: fuckthemheggiescoin.conf. In the wallet, go to settings then options and click on "Open Configuration File". This will open a blank notepad. Copy all everything from fuckthemheggiescoin.conf into the blank note pad. After that, click in your notepad, then save. At that point it safe to close your notepad. Close the settings window and restart your wallet. This will connect you to fuckthemheggiescoin network.
